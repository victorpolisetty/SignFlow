## SignFlow

SignFlow is an AI-driven contract automation platform designed to replace DocuSign for startups. It streamlines contract creation, review, and signing by integrating AI-powered automation and smart workflows.

Intelligent Auto-Fill – Automatically populates contracts with past data, user profiles, and public records like LLC filings.

Clause Explanation & Risk Detection – Highlight any clause for an AI-generated plain English explanation and risk assessment.

Adaptive Templates – Save time by turning signed contracts into reusable templates, dynamically adjusting for different signers and scenarios.

Seamless Signing & Collaboration – E-signature support with automated workflows for faster execution.
